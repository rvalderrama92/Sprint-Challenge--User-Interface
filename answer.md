1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML is the initial markup language that gives the "build" of a website page. This markup language includes elements like <p> (paragraph) so website developers understand where the paragraph starts and ends. I would have them imagine them think of HTML like the materials of a house that gives its frame and foundation. From there, if folks wanted to add doors, paint (think CSS) or electric and plumbing (Javascript) they will be able to build this around the wood and cement (HTML). 

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Two main differences between display: block and display:inline is that display:block allows the user to adjust the size of the element, where display:inline doesn't have any height or width properties. Additionally, display:inline can be nested within other elements without causing any disruptions to the overall flow of your markup, whereas display:block will break the current flow of a structure and it make start off on another line.

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Git is valuable to a team of developers because it allows developed to create a repository of different codes for projects, while also giving the developers the opportunity to fork it and create their own branch so they can work on code reviews/adding onto the code. It also adds a level of security for your team's code, while also allowing you to enter your code as an open course for the developer community to use if needed.
